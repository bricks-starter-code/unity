# Boilerplate and Debugging Files for Unity

## flatGrid.obj

128x128 flat grid. A great starting place for terrain created with a vertex shader.

## NormalsOnGPU.shader

Vertex shader that demonstrates how to calculate normals on the GPU.

## FirstPersonMinized.unitypackage

The Standard Assets package produced by Unity comes with a great first person prefab, but using requires importing the 200M+ Standard Assets package. This is the that package slimmed down to just what you need to run the First Person prefabs, but at only ~1M.
